# Code Challenges

> Holds a bunch of the code challenges I've done for fun/practice.

I tend to jump around languages willy nilly (depending on my job at the time, usually).

I'll try to maintain a list here with links to the subfolders where the problems were solved.

Most problems come from Project Euler and LeetCode.
